Wild card! Oddshocks writes a yum plugin!

When I use yum to update my system or install new packages, I sometimes
spot a package I am unfamiliar with, such as the
``mesa-dri-filesystem`` package I spotted the other day. In some GUI
extensions of yum, a brief discription of the package is listed under
each package name. I figured I'd check out some docs on writing yum plugins, to
see if I could display a description under each package name in the CLI
updater. Then the Internet was like, "Each yum plugin is a single file, written
in the Python programming language, yo", and after I cleaned up my brain
which had EXPLODED out of my HEAD I made this repo and now we are on
a science adventure.
